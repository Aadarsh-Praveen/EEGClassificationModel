About Dataset:


The CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database, a collection of EEG recordings of 22 pediatric subjects with intractable seizures, is now available. Subjects were monitored for up to several days following withdrawal of anti-seizure medication to characterize seizures and assess their candidacy for surgical intervention. In all, the onsets and ends of 182 seizures are annotated.
This database, collected at the Children’s Hospital Boston, consists of EEG recordings from pediatric subjects with intractable seizures. Subjects were monitored for up to several days following withdrawal of anti-seizure medication in order to characterize their seizures and assess their candidacy for surgical intervention. The recordings are grouped into 23 cases and were collected from 22 subjects (5 males, ages 3–22; and 17 females, ages 1.5–19).
